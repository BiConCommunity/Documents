# Documents
A place to store our community agreed process documents

# Purpose
BiCon 2021 intends to be the first BiCon dedicated to empowering our community to take BiCon into their own hands. One part of this is ensuring everyone knows what has been agreed to and how we will handle problems as they arise.

The documents in this repository are intended to help you make BiCon an amazing, inclusive and welcoming space. If you think something needs changing, please create a pull request or raise an issue
